# Business Card

A simple business card originally made as a project for the Learn React course on Scrimba.

Currently doubles as my personal website, since I did not like any of the designs of my previous attempts.[Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/dashboard?tab=overview).

### Technologies Used

* React

* JavaScript

* CSS

* HMTL


### Todo

There are still quite a few things I wish to implement yet in this project.


* Add some sort of highlight when a user hovers/focuses on a button
* Give some sort of indication of which language is chosen in the lanaguage selector (eg. an underline, highlighting the text,
* making it opaque, etc.)
* Implement light/dark mode support
* Change the favicon to something more appropriate than the CRA logo
* Create a QR code to easily share my card with smartphone users
* The tests could be better, but I don't know if I'll get back to them
