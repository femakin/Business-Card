        I am a frontend developer with a passion for taking ideas from concept
        to reality. My favorite tools are React, JavaScript, MaterialUi, Git,
        and Visual Studio Code. My aim is to learn something new with each
        project I take on. I am currently living and working in the lovely city of Lagos, Nigeria.
